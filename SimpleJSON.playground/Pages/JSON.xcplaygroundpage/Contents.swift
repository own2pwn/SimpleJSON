 # JSON
 A simple helper file for decoding and encoding json types.
 
 There are two main static functions that provide a way to easily convert between JSON and Swift representatiobs:
 - `JSON.decode(_:from:)`
 - `JSON.encode(_:)`


 There are then two simple protocols to provide a convenient way to adopt adopt the functionality with custom model objects:
 - `JSONDecodable`
 - `JSONEncodable`

 Simple as that ðŸ¤˜
